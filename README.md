SpaceWise short description

# Background
SpaceWise is the natural continaution in our efforts to bring LLM capabilities to the Space domain. Previously we have developed SpaceQA,an open-domaing extractive question answering system, that uees a  language models to identify the specific text fragment in a document collection that answers a userâ€™s query. 

## SpaceQA 
Recently, we collaborated with ESA to streamline access to information about early designs of space missions leveraging LLM. To this end we develope the QA system [SpaceQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03422) relying on a autoencoder model. SpaceQA has successfully enabled users to access information using questions in natural language that was previously available only in lengthy feasibility studies in PDF format.

### Demo

A demo of SpaceQA is available here (user/pass: sigir/s1g1r2022!): https://esatde.expertcustomers.ai/SpaceQA/

## SpaceQQuiz
We also developed a generative AI system to help the Quality Management department in ESA to generate automatically assesment material for evaluating training sessions. SpaceQQuiz leverages auto-regressive models like T5 and BART to generate questions, and a RoBERTa model to extract answers for such questions, thus verifying their suitability.

SpaceWise goes a step forward and embrace the power of generative language models conversational chatbots and retrieval augmented generation to unlock new possibilities for accessing space information, benefiting both ESA staff and space enthusiasts.
